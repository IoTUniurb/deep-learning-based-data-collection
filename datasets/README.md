# Indoor Environmental Time Series Dataset

This directory of the repository contains the files of our custom dataset.

The dataset is built by collecting ad-hoc sensor measurements related to the study of indoor air quality.
This is an increasingly relevant topic due to its substantial impact on human health, cognitive performance, and overall well-being, especially in enclosed spaces such as schools, offices, and homes, where people spend most of their time.
The dataset comprises four environmental variables measured inside the classroom of the degree program in *Computer Science and Technology* at the *University of Urbino*.

Sensors were installed in the rooms and configured to collect data every *5 minutes* for a period of over *six months*, resulting in a comprehensive, high-resolution time series.

The dataset contains measurements of the following physical quantities: 

- Carbon Dioxide ($CO_2$)
- Particulate Matter (specifically $PM_{2.5}$)
- $Noise$
- $\gamma~dose~rate$
